# Multinomial-Logistic-Regression-Paper-with-Code

Made a MLR model with paper(NOT PUBLISHED) about air quality dataset found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mujtabamatin/air-quality-and-pollution-assessment

thanks to mujtabamatin for the dataset!

I made this to showcase ability to use ML model to classify air quality and to interpret it's results (odds ratio)
